# Write a program to calculate and print the Madelung constant for sodium chloride. Use as large a value of L as you can, while still having your program run in reasonable time- say in a minute or less. Note that the physical constants drop out so you do not need to worry about them. Write two versions of the code, one which uses a for loop and one which does not. USe %timeit to determine which one is faster. 

# VERSION ONE: WITH A FOR LOOP

# We need to define the Madelung constant

# VERSION TWO: WITHOUT A FOR LOOP
